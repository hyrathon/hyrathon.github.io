# Joachim Hyrathon



> About this page: Always trying to launch a personal blog about what I did and what I learned. However, I find myself too busy to find time to do that. Finally, I decided just maintain a repo as simple as a Readme and some files, then rendering the .md with Typora's excellent feature. The theme of the html file is provided by Ursine Theme of Typora under MIT license.



## About Me

Joachim Hyrathon, a.k.a. Ioachimus Hyracentius. I am a security researcher from Qihoo 360, mainly focusing on Android related components. I have looked into some attack surfaces including NFC, Binder, Media Codecs and TrustZone. Security Researching is hard to learn, harder if we learn alone. So feel free to contact me.



I love reading stuff about history, philosophy and culture related topics in my free time. Self-proclaimed 'Spiritual Roman', diehard fans of PDX Inc., George R.R. Martin, Omar Khayyam and Italo Calvino.
