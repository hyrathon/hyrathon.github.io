# Joachim Hyrathon



> About this page: Always trying to launch a personal blog about what I did and what I learned. However, I find myself too busy to find time to do that. Finally, I decided just maintain a repo as simple as a Readme and some files, then rendering the .md with Typora's excellent feature. The theme of the html file is provided by Ursine Theme of Typora under MIT license.
